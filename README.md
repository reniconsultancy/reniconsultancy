### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

RENI, (Research, Evaluation, and Networking Initiative) is an independent organization that aims to bridge the gap between research and practice, funding and evaluation, and clients and service providers.

RENI provides consultation on program design, implementation, and evaluation to community service providers (non-profits, counseling centers, community corporations, etc.) to establish research based practices and enhance client centered goals.
We rely on community partnership and shared expertise to help organizations and agencies reach their goals through effective strategic planning, program development and implementation, and evaluations.
